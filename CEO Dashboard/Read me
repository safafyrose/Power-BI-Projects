* **Working Capital Management Insights:**
    * Key metrics visualization:
        * Days Receivable Outstanding (DRO) for collection effectiveness.

* **Visually Driven Communication:**
    * Clean and intuitive dashboard design principles applied for easy comprehension.
    * Strategic use of diverse Power BI visuals (line charts, bar charts, column charts, gauge charts, card visuals).
    * Consistent color scheme and clear labeling for enhanced readability.

## Technologies Used

* **Power BI:** The core platform for all data visualization, report design, and interactive dashboard development.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Employed to create complex calculated fields, measures, and performance indicators essential for in-depth analysis and comparisons.
* **Data Modeling:** Implementation of robust data modeling techniques to effectively connect and optimize data sourced from various systems (e.g., sales databases, financial systems, HR platforms).

## Purpose

This strategic dashboard serves as a central, interactive tool empowering the CEO and leadership team to:
