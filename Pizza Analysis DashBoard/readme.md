## Pizza Analysis Dashboard using PowerBI and SQL

This project entails creating a dashboard to analyze pizza sales data. The data is processed and queried using SQL to derive key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, sales by category and size, and top and bottom performers. Power BI is then employed to visualize these insights and create an interactive dashboard for users to explore. The dashboard aims to provide valuable insights into pizza sales performance and help stakeholders make informed decisions.
